TODO:
- Add a Base components thing to get to feature complete for the server-provisioning example.
  This is where the RawAPI, Header can go. Also where head/foot HTML things go? And asset files? Reusable templates?
- Rename the current 'components' to something more appropriate - Main components? App components? Modules? Plugins? 
  These are things that are not part of the base.
- Rework codemirror integration so that it can be a standalone module;
  It requires code in other modules/page templates at the moment, would be a lot nicer if that was not the case. It should be more a plugin type thing.
- Have a way to reorganize code (sorting within a module, moving code from one module to another).
- Add a compile/build/pack step to bundle everything.
- Improve styling: at least for the buttons and back links. Reuse simply-edit backend style?

Misc ideas:
- Add full screen view to edit a specific part 
- Have a way to add tests for a component/part
  Should run directly in the browser. 
  Run this whenever a component/part changes to keep the feedback look short.

- Add an app overview page with statistics, lines of code spent
- Design system, where does it fit in?

- Keyboard shortcuts?
- Can we reorganize the code on disk so that editing files directly is feasable?
- How can we do git and/or versioning?

- Add a way to browse and edit the code by topic (routes, commands, actions) instead of modules.

Done:
[v] Add syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, HTML mixed mode etc.
