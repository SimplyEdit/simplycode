Bugs:
- issue with codemirror width being weird. We need to lock down the table widths to get this working properly;
- after deleting a part, codemirror needs to reinitialize;

TODO:
[v] CSS syntax highlighting
- Add an option for adding assets? in base components/

- Where do sorters go? Add them to page components at least?
- Rename the current 'components' to something more appropriate - Main components? App components? Modules? Plugins? 
  These are things that are not part of the base.
- Rework codemirror integration so that it can be a standalone module;
  It requires code in other modules/page templates at the moment, would be a lot nicer if that was not the case. It should be more a plugin type thing.
- Have a way to reorganize code (sorting within a module, moving code from one module to another).
- Add a compile/build/pack step to bundle everything.
- Improve styling: at least for the buttons and back links. Reuse simply-edit backend style?

Misc ideas:
- Add full screen view to edit a specific part 

- Have a way to add tests for a component/part
  Should run directly in the browser. 
  Run this whenever a component/part changes to keep the feedback look short.

  Backstopjs-like comparison of changes?
  QUnit for tests?

- Add an app overview page with statistics, lines of code spent
- Design system, where does it fit in?

- Keyboard shortcuts?
- Can we reorganize the code on disk so that editing files directly is feasable?
- How can we do git and/or versioning?

- Add a way to browse and edit the code by topic (routes, commands, actions) instead of modules.

- Add a preview mode for a component preview:
  - shows HTML + CSS of the current component/page;
  - add buttons to show commands, transformers, data sources
    - with an option to show a specific one, or a subset;
    - show a different color for commands that have no code?
  
	[data-simply-command=deleteEntry]::before {
	  content: attr(data-simply-command);
	  position: absolute;
	  border: 2px dotted steelblue;
	  background-color: #f4f4bf;
	  padding: 4px;
	  margin-top: -34px;
	  margin-left: -7px;
	}

	- In preview mode: add data-simply-commands that navigate to the command code instead of executing that code;
	- Add sample data for components to show

Done:
[v] Add syntax highlighting for HTML, HTML mixed mode etc.
[v] Add a page CSS entry
[v] CSS syntax highlighting
[v] reorder to frontend-first ordering, so start with html/css instead of the data api.
[v] Add a Base components thing to get to feature complete for the server-provisioning example.
    This is where the RawAPI, Header can go.
    Also where head/foot HTML things go? And asset files? Bootstrap? CodeMirror scripts? Reusable templates?
[v] Add an option for Header and Footer? in base components? -> can be done using bodyHtml and footHtml;
[v] Add an option for commands/actions in base components?

Bugs fixed:
[v] running codemirror twice on the same textarea causes it to go wonky
